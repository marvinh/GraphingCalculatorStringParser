# GraphingCalculatorStringParser
This is a program I completed as a final project for a computer science course. 
It encompasses everything I learned that semester. 
The GUI and window system were implement with SFML,
but the classes should be generic enough to use with any graphical framework.
This program was a little rushed, and I have not revisited it since, but it was a great learning experience.
The algorithm implemented for the string parsing can be found in the Syard Class and on this wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm
